Just my drafts on algorithms training. This is totally not-ever-ready for viewers, but this is some sort of motivation for me â€” not to be scared to shown as a not-a-perfect developer.

This is for write-only purposes, so:

- no readable variable names
- no ruby style guide

This is completely about my learning way, nice looking algorithms implementations can be found on internet (not in this repo :) )
